# Solving constraints with Z3 using Rust

Some random examples of solving constraints with Z3 using Rust, mostly from problem generated by chatGPT or Claude (feel free to open issues with any fun new ones).
Idea of this repo is to improve my knowledge of the z3 crate

## Problem 1
"You are organizing a team meeting with three participants: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. You need to satisfy the following constraints:
	1.	If Alice attends the meeting, Bob must attend.
	2.	If Bob attends the meeting, Charlie cannot attend.
	3.	At least one of Alice or Charlie must attend the meeting.

Can you determine whether these constraints can be satisfied, and if so, find a valid arrangement?"

If I'm correct, this is an arity of 2, meaning polynomial time complexity (2-sat).
(A -> B) ^ (B -> !C) ^ (A v C)
